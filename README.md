# tp-Jobs 💼
#  Careers: My employment portal💗
## By María Macarena Álvarez Castillo.👨‍💻

📋To create this repository I put into practice everything I learned in the **third module** of the **Ada ITW** **Frontend** course.

📈The used tecnologies were **HTML5 and Javascript**. This website was built with Tailwindcss.

💻The portal has:
- Header with navigation links
- Main section
- A form that allows you to filter the job search through the location, seniority or category fields. The search performed will show all the results matching what the user chooses.
- The possibility of creating a new job by means of a form.
- The user can delete and edit existing jobs.
- Pagination

---
### In this asynchronous module I learned to work with APIs and use the 4 methods🌐 : get, put, post and delete.
I lso improved from my previous work in handling tailwind css. I hope you notice and like it.
